# UNIONS

**WHAT IS IT?**:
- It combines the results of two or more SELECT statements
- 'UNION' alone does not allow duplicate
- 'UNION ALL' will display duplicates from tables

# VIEWS

**WHAT IS IT?**:
- It's a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement
- The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the DB
- They're not real tables but can be interacted with as if they were
- The benefit of view is that we donâ€™t have to repeat data in a real table
